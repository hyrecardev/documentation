# GraphQL IDEs

## Desktop IDEs

All IDEs listed below will be supported out of the box for any development environment you will be running HyreCar's GraphQL API on.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend using [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground/releases), but any of the following should work fine.

## Chrome Extension IDEs

Extension based IDEs are a fairly new concept and HyreCar may look into these in the future to test Chrome specific performance, however, the following IDEs have never been used or configured, so should you use them, please feel free to contribute to this section!
