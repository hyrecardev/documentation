## Setup

We are using express.js for our server itself.  The server is has three possible configurations-- public and internal as routes \(`/api` and `/internal`\)  or just public or internal on the root path `/`

You can see how this setup works from the code here: [https://gitlab.com/hyrecar-dev/backend-v2/services/blob/master/services/gateway/src/app.ts](https://gitlab.com/hyrecar-dev/backend-v2/services/blob/master/services/gateway/src/app.ts)

We also use Apollo engine to give us detailed insights on every query which gets passed to our server.
